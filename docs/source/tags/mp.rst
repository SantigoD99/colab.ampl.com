| Description: Scheduling model for harbor operations. It is a problem with dependences between containers, which should be dispatch the fastest possible. We are using the MP solver interfaces to model a complex system using techniques from Constraint Programming, such as indicator constraints, and logical or and forall operators. After the model is written, a couple instances are presented and Highs/Gurobi MIP solvers are used to tackle the problem.
