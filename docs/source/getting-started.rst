Getting Started
===============

Quick setup
-----------

In order to be use AMPL on any notebook platform (e.g., Google Colab) you just need the following two code blocks
at the beginning of your notebook:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install dependencies
   %pip install -q amplpy


.. code-block:: python

    # Google Colab & Kaggle integration
    from amplpy import AMPL, ampl_notebook

    ampl = ampl_notebook(
        modules=["coin", "highs", "gokestrel"],  # modules to install
        license_uuid="your-license-uuid",  # license to use
    )  # instantiate AMPL object and register magics

In the list ``modules`` you can specify the AMPL solvers you want to use in your notebook.
For more information on the AMPL Modules for Python see `Python Modules Documentation <https://dev.ampl.com/ampl/python/modules.html>`_.
For more information on how to use ``amplpy`` see `Python API Documentation <https://amplpy.readthedocs.io/>`_.

        Quick Start using Pandas dataframes
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Data can be loaded in various forms, one of which is ``pandas.DataFrame`` objects.

        Quick Start using lists and dictionaries
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Data can be loaded in various forms, including Python lists and dictionaries.

.. note::

    In these notebooks there are ``%%ampl_eval`` cells that allow you to run AMPL code directly from the notebook. 
    They are equivalent to ``ampl.eval("""cell content""")``.

AMPL is free on Colab
---------------------

- On **Google Colab** there is a default `AMPL Community Edition license <https://ampl.com/ce/>`_
  that gives you **unlimited access to AMPL
  with open-source solvers** (e.g., HiGHS, CBC, Couenne, Ipopt, Bonmin)
  or with commercial solvers from the `NEOS Server <https://www.neos-server.org/>`_ as described in `Kestrel documentation <https://dev.ampl.com/solvers/kestrel.html>`_.

- `AMPL for Courses <https://ampl.com/licenses-and-pricing/ampl-for-teaching/>`_ is another free license of full-featured AMPL with no limitations on problem size, and a selection of popular commercial and open-source solvers.
  **This license can be used on Google Colab and similar platforms for teaching.**

- To access commercial solvers you can use solver trials associated with your `AMPL Community Edition license <https://ampl.com/ce/>`_.

AMPL Python API: amplpy
-----------------------

`amplpy <https://amplpy.readthedocs.io>`_ is an interface that allows developers to access the features of `AMPL <https://ampl.com>`_ from within Python.
For a quick introduction to AMPL see `Quick Introduction to AMPL <https://dev.ampl.com/ampl/introduction.html>`_.

In the same way that AMPL's syntax matches naturally the mathematical description of the model,
the input and output data matches naturally Python lists, sets, dictionaries, ``pandas`` and ``numpy`` objects.

All model generation and solver interaction is handled directly by AMPL, which leads to
great stability and speed; the library just acts as an intermediary, and the added overhead (in terms of memory and
CPU usage) depends mostly on how much data is sent and read back from AMPL, the size of the expanded model as such is irrelevant.

With `amplpy <https://amplpy.readthedocs.io>`_ you can model and solve large scale optimization problems in Python with the performance of heavily optimized C code
without losing model readability. The same model can be deployed on applications
built on different languages by just switching the API used.
