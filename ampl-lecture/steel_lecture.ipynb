        "At the end of the example above we have displayed the \"marginal values\" (also called \"dual values\" or \"shadow prices\") associated with the Time constraints. The marginal value of a constraint measures how much the value of the objective would improve if the constraint were relaxed by a small amount. For example, here we would expect that up to some point, additional reheat time would produce another \\$1800 of extra profit per hour, and additional rolling time would produce \\$3200 per hour; decreasing these times would decrease the profit correspondingly. In output commands like display, AMPL interprets a constraint's name alone as referring to the associated marginal values.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also display several quantities associated with the variables Make. First there are lower bounds Make.lb and upper bounds Make.ub, which in this case are the same as commit and market. We also show the \"reduced cost\" Make.rc, which has the same meaning with respect to the bounds that the marginal values have with respect to the constraints. Thus we see that, again up to some point, each increase of a ton in the lower bound (or commitment) for coil production should reduce profits by about \\$1.86; each one-ton decrease in the lower bound should improve profits by about \\$1.86. The production levels for bands and plates are between their bounds, so their reduced costs are essentially zero, and changing their levels will have no effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparing this session with our previous one, we see that the additional reheat time restriction reduces profits by about \\$4750, and forces a substantial change in the optimal solution: much higher production of plate and lower production of bands. Moreover, the logic underlying the optimum is no longer so obvious. It is the difficulty of solving LPs by logical reasoning alone that necessitates computer-based systems such as AMPL.\n",
