        "## Example: Transportation problem\n",
        "Two fundamental sets of objects underlie the transportation problem: the sources or origins (mills, in our example) and the destinations (factories). Thus we begin the AMPL model with a declaration of these two sets:\n",
        "```ampl\n",
        "set ORIG;\n",
        "set DEST;\n",
        "```\n",
        "There is a supply of something at each origin (tons of steel coils produced, in our case), and a demand for the same thing at each destination (tons of coils ordered). AMPL defines nonnegative quantities like these with param statements indexed over a set; in this case we add one extra refinement, a check statement to test the data for validity:\n",
        "```ampl\n",
        "param supply {ORIG} >= 0;\n",
        "param demand {DEST} >= 0;\n",
        "check: sum {i in ORIG} supply[i] = sum {j in DEST} demand[j];\n",
        "```\n",
        "The check statement says that the sum of the supplies has to equal the sum of the demands. The way that our model is to be set up, there can't possibly be any solutions unless this condition is satisfied. By putting it in a check statement, we tell AMPL to test this condition after reading the data, and to issue an error message if it is violated.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each combination of an origin and a destination, there is a transportation cost and a variable representing the amount transported. Again, the ideas from previous chapters are easily adapted to produce the appropriate AMPL statements:\n",
        "```ampl\n",
        "param cost {ORIG,DEST} >= 0;\n",
        "var Trans {ORIG,DEST} >= 0;\n",

        "For a particular origin `i` and destination `j`, we ship `Trans[i,j]` units from `i` to `j`, at a cost of `cost[i,j]` per unit; the total cost for this pair is\n",

        "cost[i,j] * Trans[i,j]\n",
        "```\n",
        "Adding over all pairs, we have the objective function:\n",

        "As long as you express the objective in some mathematically correct way, AMPL will sort out the terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "It remains to specify the two collections of constraints, those at the origins and those at the destinations. If we name these collections Supply and Demand, their declarations will start as follows:\n",

        "```ampl\n",
        "sum {j in DEST} Trans[i,j]\n",
        "```\n",
        "Since we have already defined a parameter supply indexed over origins, the amount available at i is supply[i]. Thus the constraint is\n",

        "subject to Supply {i in ORIG}:\n",

        "\n",
        "We have been consistent in using the index i to run over the set ORIG, and the index j to run over DEST. This is not an AMPL requirement, but such a convention makes it easier to read a model.

        "\n",
        "As the name suggests, a transportation model is applicable whenever some material is being shipped from a set of origins to a set of destinations. Given certain amounts available at the origins, and required at the destinations, the problem is to meet the requirements at a minimum shipping cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "Viewed more broadly, transportation models do not have to be concerned with the shipping of \"materials\". They can be applied to the transportation of anything, provided that the quantities available and required can be measured in some units, and that the transportation cost per unit can be determined. They might be used to model the shipments of automobiles to dealers, for example, or the movement of military personnel to new assignments.\n",
        "\n",
        "In an even broader view, transportation models need not deal with \"shipping\" at all. The quantities at the origins may be merely associated with various destinations, while the objective measures some value of the association that has nothing to do with actually moving anything. Often the result is referred to as an ***assignment*** model.\n",
        "\n",
        "As one particularly well-known example, consider a department that needs to assign some number of people to an equal number of offices. The origins now represent individual people, and the destinations represent individual offices. Since each person is assigned one office, and each office is occupied by one person, all of the parameter values `supply[i]` and `demand[j]` are 1. We interpret `Trans[i,j]` as the \"amount\" of person `i` that is assigned to office `j`; that is, if `Trans[i,j]` is 1 then person i will occupy office j, while if `Trans[i,j]` is 0 then person i will not occupy office j.\n",
        "\n",
        "What of the objective? One possibility is to ask people to rank the offices, giving their first choice, second choice, and so forth. Then we can let `cost[i,j]` be the rank that person i gives to office `j`. This convention lets each objective function term `cost[i,j]*Trans[i,j]` represent the preference of person i for office j, if person i is assigned to office j (`Trans[i,j]` equals 1), or zero if person i is not assigned to office j (`Trans[i,j]` equals 0). Since the objective is the sum of all these terms, it must equal the sum of all the nonzero terms, which is the sum of everyone's rankings for the offices to which they were assigned. By minimizing this sum, we can hope to find an assignment that will please a lot of people.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use the transportation model for this purpose, we need only supply the appropriate data. We are presenting an example with 11 people to be assigned to 11 offices. The default option has been used to set all the supply and demand values to 1 without typing all the 1's. If we store this data set in `assign.dat`, we can use it with the transportation model that we already have:"

But how did we know that every `Trans[i,j]` would equal either 0 or 1 in the optimal solution, rather than, say, 1/2 ? We were able to rely on a special property of transportation models, which guarantees that as long as all supply and demand values are integers, and all lower and upper bounds on the variables are integers, there will be an optimal solution that is entirely integral. Moreover, we used a solver that always finds one of these integral solutions. But don't let this favorable result mislead you into assuming that integrality can be assured in all other circumstances; even in examples that seem to be much like the transportation model, finding integral solutions can require a special solver, and a lot more work.\n",

In applications on this scale, however, most of the assignments can be ruled out in advance, so that the number of actual decision variables is not too large. After looking at an initial solution, you may want to rule out some more assignments - in our example, perhaps no assignment to lower than fifth choice should be allowed - or you may want to force some assignments to be made a certain way, in order to see how the rest could be done optimally. These situations require models that can deal with subsets of pairs (of people and offices, or origins and destinations) in a direct way."
