        "set OUTPUT;           # outputs\n",
        "param cost {INPUT} > 0;\n",

        "\n",
        "The objects that were called *foods* and *nutrients* in the diet model are now referred to more generically as *inputs* and *outputs*. For each input `j`, we must decide to use a quantity `X[j]` that lies between `in_min[j]` and `in_max[j]`; as a result we incur a cost equal to `cost[j]·X[j]`, and we create `io[i,j]·X[j]` units of each output `i`. Our goal is to find the least-cost combination of inputs that yields, for each output `i`, an amount between `out_min[i]` and `out_max[i]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "In one common class of applications for this model, the inputs are raw materials to be mixed together. The outputs are qualities of the resulting **blend**. The raw materials could be the components of an animal feed, but they could equally well be the crude oil derivatives that are blended to make gasoline, or the different kinds of coal that are mixed as input to a coke oven. The qualities can be amounts of something (sodium or calories for animal feed), or more complex measures (vapor pressure or octane rating for gasoline), or even physical properties such as weight and volume.\n",
        "\n",
        "In another well-known application, the inputs are production activities of some sector of an **economy**, and the outputs are various products. The `in_min` and `in_max` parameters are limits on the levels of the activities, while `out_min` and `out_max` are regulated by demands. Thus the goal is to find levels of the activities that meet demand at the lowest cost. This interpretation is related to the concept of an economic equilibrium.\n",
        "\n",
        "In still another, quite different application, the inputs are **work schedules**, and the outputs correspond to hours worked on certain days of a month. For a particular work schedule `j`, `io[i,j]` is the number of hours that a person following schedule `j` will work on day `i` (zero if none), `cost[j]` is the monthly salary for a person following schedule `j`, and `X[j]` is the number of workers assigned that schedule. Under this interpretation, the objective becomes the total cost of the monthly payroll, while the constraints say that for each day `i`, the total number of workers assigned to work that day must lie between the limits `out_min[i]` and `out_max[i]`. The same approach can be used in a variety of other scheduling contexts, where the hours, days or months are replaced by other periods of time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although linear programming can be very useful in applications like these, we need to keep in mind the assumptions that underlie the LP model. We have already mentioned the \"continuity\" assumption whereby `X[j]` is allowed to take on any value between `in_min[j]` and `in_max[j]`. This may be a lot more reasonable for blending than for scheduling.\n",
        "\n",
        "As another example, in writing the objective as\n",
        "```ampl\n",
        "sum {j in INPUT} cost[j] * X[j]\n",
        "```\n",
        "we are assuming \"linearity of costs\", that is, that the cost of an input is proportional to the amount of the input used, and that the total cost is the sum of the inputs' individual costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In writing the constraints as\n",
        "```ampl\n",
        "out_min[i] <= sum {j in INPUT} io[i,j] * X[j] <= out_max[i]\n",
        "```\n",
        "we are also assuming that the yield of an output `i` from a particular input is proportional to the amount of the input used, and that the total yield of an output `i` is the sum of the yields from the individual inputs. This \"linearity of yield\" assumption poses no problem when the inputs are schedules, and the outputs are hours worked. But in the blending example, linearity is a physical assumption about the nature of the raw materials and the qualities, which may or may not hold. In early applications to refineries, for example, it was recognized that the addition of lead as an input had a nonlinear effect on the quality known as octane rating in the resulting blend.\n",
